"""
Interactive Corpus Analysis Tool
================================

ICAT is an interactive machine learning (IML) dashboard for unlabeled text datasets
that allows a user to iteratively and visually define features, explore and label
instances of their dataset, and train a logistic regression model on the fly as they
do so to assist in filtering, searching, anc labelling tasks.

For the full documentation, vist https://ornl.github.io/curifactory/latest/index.html

Usage in a nutshell
-------------------

Inside a jupyter notebook/lab, run:

>>> import icat
>>> icat.initialize()
>>> df = ... # load in some data that has a column with text you want to explore
>>> model = icat.Model(df, text_col="name_of_df_column_with_text")
>>> model.view

The ``model.view`` returns a panel component that will render inside Jupyter and
display the IML interface.

    Note that there's a weird conflict between ipyvuetify and panel where if you don't
    run this initialize function, you may need to run your first ``model.view`` cell twice
    for the stylesheets to correctly apply to some of the ipyvuetify datatables.

        offline (bool): If set to true, will configure panel to draw js/css resources from \
            local packages rather than hitting a CDN for them.
